To run the code, please use Python 3 and see the following instructions.

The following libraries are required: networkx, numpy, pandas, falconn, sklearn, scipy, glob, matplotlib, seaborn, networkit.

To conduct the experiments for the various measures of centrality, please run fmcl.py. The results will be saved in the folder tables.

To conduct the experiments for the various measures of projected centrality without comparing against the adapted competing solvers, please run real_centrality/experiments.py. The results will be saved in the folder real_centrality/tables.

To conduct the experiments for the various measures of projected centrality with comparing against the adapted competing solvers, please run real_centrality/adp_experiments.py. The results will be saved in the folder real_centrality/adptables.
